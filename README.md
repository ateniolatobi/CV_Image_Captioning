# Computer Vision Automatic Image Captioning

## Description

This project is the second project of the _Deep Learning nanodegree_, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** ([https://eu.udacity.com](https://eu.udacity.com/)), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

The project objective is to create and train a deep learning classifier that can look at Images or Video Frames and give a detailed textual description of the Image Scene.
A project like this can have applications in assisting the visually Impaired to perceive and understand their environment and also in creating a platform for labeling Unlabelled Datasets.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:

-   The file  _**2_Training.html**_, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the code used to train the deep learning classifier;
-   The file  _**3_Inference.html**_, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the code used to make an inference with the deep learning classifier after training;
-   The file  _model.py_, contains the model architecture

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to  **PyTorch**  ([https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by  **Facebook**  and its  **FAIR**  (Facebook AI Research) team ([https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/)).
